#### Atomic Design
![click Visit Site](../../../Readme/Components/Atoms.jpg)
Components are split to small parts, so-called atoms. You can find them in :
> src/components/atoms

Atoms are connected to molecules. They are bigger components and you can find them in
> src/components/molecules

Organisms are even bigger blocks build by Molecules and Atoms. They can be find in:
> src/components/organisms

This way of splitting components made them more reusable and more findable.
Moreover, thanks to this approach most components are small and have short code.
